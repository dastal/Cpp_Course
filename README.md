# Cpp_Course
 C++ Tutorial


Tutorial I completed to get used to C++ programming language and to continue my overview over the most important programming languages. Used tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLnPwxZdW4Y&t=117s

**Setup**
- IDE: http://codeblocks.org/downloads/26#windows - Select "codeblocks-xx.xxmingw-setup.exe" Download from: Sourceforge.net

**Creating New Project**
- Open CodeBlocks
- Hit "Create new a project"
- Bare Basic Project: Hit "Console application" -> "Next" -> Choose "C++" and hit "Next" -> Enter Project Name (here: Cpp_Tutorial) and choose the project folder, hit "Next" -> Hit "Finish"
- At the left-hand-side there should appear the project workspace with the folder: "{Project_Name}" containing the folder "Sources" which contains the file "main.cpp"
- Right-click on "main.cpp" and open it
- It should look the following way:

```#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
    cout << "Hello world!" << endl;
    return 0;
}
```
- To continue, click the icon "Build and Run" in the Toolbar (a green triangle and a gray gear). This should open a window which says "Hello World"
